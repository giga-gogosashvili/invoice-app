# Invoice app

Project inspired by [Invoice app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl). Design and app concept are taken from the challenge.

## Overview

Invoice app is tracking invoices issued by small company. In the app users can:

- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)

UI solutions:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on device's screen size (desctop, tablet, mobile)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle light and dark mode

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [MUI Styled Components](https://mui.com/) - for styles
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - for end-to-end tests
- [Go](https://go.dev/) - for back-end

### Continued development

Plan for app development:

- fully back-end app,
- user registration & login,
- sending invoice via Email,
- generate pdf from invoice.
